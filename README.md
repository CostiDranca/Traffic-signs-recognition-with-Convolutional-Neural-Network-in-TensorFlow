# Traffic-signs-recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network-in-TensorFlow

This is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow. The network should learn how to clasify traffic signs into 62 classes. I am still working on it, in this moment it doesn't learn very good, not a high succes rate. I want to try another arhitecture like AlexNet or VG16, increase input images dimensions, and maybe make it learn from rgb images, in this stage, for learning are used only gray images.

As optimizer I used Adam and for loss function Binary cross emtropy with logits.
